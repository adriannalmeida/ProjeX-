| Username | Password |
| -------- | -------- |
| admin_alice    | hashed_password_1 |

#### 2.2. User Credentials

| Type          | Username  | Password |

### 3. Application Help

We aimed to design an app that is both intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring that all features are straightforward and self-explanatory. Each input field is accompanied by a clear placeholder or label, providing guidance on the expected content. Additionally, buttons include tooltips that appear when hovered over, offering concise explanations of their functionality for enhanced clarity. To further enhance user understanding, we included an "About Us" page, offering insights into what ProjeX is all about.

### 4. Input Validation

Input data validation was implemented on both the client-side and server-side to ensure data integrity, security, and a smooth user experience. 
Client-side validation provides immediate feedback to the user, preventing invalid data from being sent to the server unnecessarily. Server-side validation ensures the integrity and security of incoming data that must respect specific constraints before it is saved in the database. 

### 5. Check Accessibility and Usability

The checklist of accessibility and usability can be seen in the following links:

### 8. Implementation Details

#### 8.1. Libraries Used
- Laravel Framework: A PHP framework for building web applications. The entire product is built on Laravel for backend logic and API handling. Examples of its implementation can be found in [routes/web.php](https://gitlab.up.pt/lbaw/lbaw2425/lbaw24044/-/blob/main/routes/web.php) for defining web routes and in the controllers located in [app/Http/Controllers](https://gitlab.up.pt/lbaw/lbaw2425/lbaw24044/-/tree/main/app/Http/Controllers). Detailed documentation can be accessed on the [Laravel Official Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x).
- Pusher PHP Server: A library to integrate WebSocket-based real-time functionality. We used it to enable real-time notifications and updates for users. This functionality is defined in the [app/Events](https://gitlab.up.pt/lbaw/lbaw2425/lbaw24044/-/tree/main/app/Events) directory, which broadcasts events, and respective controllers and javascript files. More details about Pusher can be found in its [documentation](https://pusher.com/docs/beams/reference/server-sdk-php/).
- Mailtrap PHP: A library to manage email testing. It was used to test email functionality during development. Configurations for Mailtrap are defined in [config/mail.php](https://gitlab.up.pt/lbaw/lbaw2425/lbaw24044/-/blob/main/config/mail.php), and email templates can be found in [invitation.blade.php](https://gitlab.up.pt/lbaw/lbaw2425/lbaw24044/-/blob/main/resources/views/pages/invitation.blade.php) . The official [Mailtrap documentation](https://api-docs.mailtrap.io/) provides more insights.
- ChartJS for Laravel: Integration of Chart.js with Laravel for data visualization.It was used to generates visual charts for data analytics about project events on project timeline page. Examples of this integration can be seen in [projectTimeline.blade.php](https://gitlab.up.pt/lbaw/lbaw2425/lbaw24044/-/blob/main/resources/views/pages/projectTimeline.blade.php), where project timelines are rendered as charts. The [Chart.js documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/) contains additional information.
- Font Awesome: A library for scalable vector icons. It was used to provide icons for buttons, navigation, and status indicators. They are implemented in various files, such as [sidebar.blade.php](https://gitlab.up.pt/lbaw/lbaw2425/lbaw24044/-/blob/main/resources/views/partials/sidebar.blade.php) for the project navigation bar and [adminViewAccounts.blade.php](https://gitlab.up.pt/lbaw/lbaw2425/lbaw24044/-/blob/main/resources/views/partials/adminViewAccounts.blade.php) for user action buttons like edit, block, or delete. Additional resources are available on the [Font Awesome Official Website](https://fontawesome.com/).
